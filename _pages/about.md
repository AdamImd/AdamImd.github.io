<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


Hi, I’m Adam Imdieke, a Ph.D. student in Robotics at the University of Minnesota. My research focuses on developing wearable force sensors that allow robots to sense, interpret, and respond to physical contact with the world around them. By integrating principles from design, mechanics, and sensing technology, I aim to create intelligent, responsive systems that can interact with people and their environments more naturally and safely.

I’m especially interested in how wearable materials and soft interfaces can enhance robotic perception—helping robots not just move, but feel. My work bridges disciplines, combining design and prototyping with inverse kinematics and machine learning to build systems that better perceive and adapt to the world around them.

When I’m not in the lab, you’ll likely find me climbing, building things, or bikepacking around Minneapolis.
