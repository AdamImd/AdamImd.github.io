We predict video sequences of robot interactions using pre-trained video diffusion models and use these predictions to plan actions. This enable zero-shot manipulation policy learning approach that leverages large-scale video diffusion models without any additional training.

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-sm-10 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/GenAI/WAN.gif" title="Zero-Shot Robotic Manipulation using Video Diffusion Models" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

We utilize pre-trained video diffusion models (WAN) to generate future video frames conditioned on the current observation and a text prompt giving the desired action. We then use these predicted video sequences to plan robot actions with a Diffusion Policy. This approach allows us to perform various manipulation tasks without any task-specific training, demonstrating the potential of large-scale video diffusion models for zero-shot robotic manipulation.

    </div>

The Diffusion Policy takes as input the current observation, along with a feature that encodes the predicted video frames from the WAN model. The feature is generated by using the current observation as the query and the predicted video frames as the keys and values in a cross-attention mechanism. The Diffusion Policy then generates a sequence of robot actions that are expected to lead to the desired outcome as seen in the predicted video frames.












<!-- OLD PAGE

Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/5.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %} -->
